# TODO List for Upgrading Invitation Form to Professional Job-Oriented Version

- [x] Update HTML structure in index.html: Change title to "Interview Invitation", add form with fields (Company Name, Role, Interview Date, Interview Time, Mode, Contact Email, Message), rewrite text formally.
- [x] Add embedded CSS for clean, responsive, professional design: Use professional fonts, spacing, adjust/remove background image, ensure mobile-friendliness.
- [x] Add embedded JavaScript: Handle form submission, validate inputs, generate and display professional invitation letter below the form.
- [x] Test form functionality and responsiveness in browser.
- [x] Ensure no unnecessary complexity added and maintain frontend-only approach.
